# Overview of Analysis
### Bikesharing is very popular in urban areas. It is a fun way to explore a city, it is great exercise, and it is great alternative for commuters. 

## Results
#### Using Tableau, we are able to quickly visualize how NYC Citibikes can be a great investment.

# Summary
Looking at the data and visuals, we can see that NYC CitiBikes would be a good investment for the following reasons:
1) It is not necessary to spread out pick up and drop off all over the city and we can use the data to have bike rental locations in the densely used areas
2) We can use the visuals to determine when is the best time to have many bikes available to rent based on the weekday or time of day and when is the best time to perform maintenance on the bikes
3) We can use the gender results to determine how many types of bikes to order, whether it is a female or male fit.

### Additional Analysis
To better add to the dataset visualizations, I would create a visual to label the start and end station names to help identify the locations instead of coordinates. I would also include what bikeids are located at which start and stop locations to have a better idea of inventory.
